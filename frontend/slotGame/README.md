# Task
The task is to write a small application, which you will then share with us for code review, a practice that is heavily utilized in NetEnt.
The general principles by which the application will be evaluated are readability, reusability and maintainability. 
Your task is to build a small slot game based on the existing basic setup found in `public` and `src`.

## Specifications
The application has the follow requirements
* TypeScript
* Server should be a Node.js App
* React, Angular or similar is not allowed. Express is allowed

### Client
* Perform an outcome request to the server
* Display the result returned by the server using the provided graphical resources
* Display the Win type
* Support the Bonus feature

### Server
* Receive request from client and return a randomized outcome
* The outcome should be three random integers between 0-5
* Support Bonus feature

### Win type
* Three types of win types: No Win, Small Win and Big Win
* Two equal integers constitute a Small Win
* Three equal integers constitute a Big Win
* Any other outcome constitutes a No Win

### Bonus feature
* The Bonus rewards the player with a free request
* The server should randomly return whether the feature is triggered or not along with the regular response
* The client should present the regular result returned, then if the feature is triggered, perform a new request without any user input

## Submission process
