# Backend - Simple Game Server Assignment

## Introduction

As part of applying to us, we would like you to complete the following code assignment using Java. We suggest that you spend around 4 to 8 hours to complete the tasks.

The goal of this task is to demonstrate your skills in designing, structuring and writing code. We understand that depending on your experience with similar tasks you may find it straightforward or difficult. Therefore, we will review and consider incomplete implementations. However, in this case we ask that:
* You focus on domain logic and structure of your solution instead of technical implementation details, such
  as applying third party libraries to implement the communication layer
* You briefly list all the limitations (such as missing or incomplete functionality) of your solution.

## Make a game service in Java

### Part 1
You are tasked with creating a RESTful service from which players can play a simple game.
The return to player (RTP) is expected to be 97%. This means you need to calculate to probability of the different win levels and how often a win can occur.
General rule is a small win should occur more frequently than a medium win, and a medium win should occur more frequently than a big win.
> Calculation for RTP: The total amount returned to players divided by the total bets by players.
> Example:  outcome after 100 rounds: amount returned to players = 194€, total bets 200€, RTP:  194/200 = 97%.

The requirements for the service are:

#### init requests
* It should return the initial state of the game and include the following information:
  * ´Balance´ with initial amount 5000€

#### play requests
* It should handle a play request, which can have 2 different modes play for free and play for cash
  * ´Play for free´ – bets are never deducted from balance
  * ´Play for cash´ – bets are deducted from balance
  * Any winnings will be added to the balance
  * The outcome should include the new balance
* It should accept any bet between 1€ and 10€
* In any round
  * The win can be small 3x the bet amount, medium 10x the bet amount and big 50x the bet amount
  * The player can win one free round.
* Free round works in the same way as a normal round except that no bet is deducted from the balance. The free round should follow immediately after winning a free round.
* The player can both win money and a free round at the same time.

### Part 2
Payout simulation to verify RTP
* Create an acceptance test that plays 10000 game rounds.
* The test should verify that the RTP is around 97%


## Documentation

Please include a concise `ReadMe.md` file with the following:
* Known limitations of your solution
* Key design decisions made, especially if you considered multiple options
* Documentation on how to use the APIs and start the service

We do not require the documentation to be verbose or lengthy - short descriptions are acceptable, and details
can be discussed on the interview.

### Finally

Please make necessary assumptions wherever required

Please publish the solution in a private [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository and give the user [@evo-home-task](https://github.com/evo-home-task) access to the repository.

Good Luck!
